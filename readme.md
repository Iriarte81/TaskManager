About This Series

So you're at the initial stage, where you've toyed with Laravel, but haven't quited dug in yet? Great! Let's build a little tool together, as an exercise.

So you're at the initial stage, where you've toyed with Laravel, but haven't quite dug in yet? Great! Let's build a little app together.

## Design and Migrations

Let's take just a moment (and I mean "moment") to tweak the design to be somewhat more friendly. Next, we'll discuss the power of migrations and seed files.

## Relationships

Moving along, we'll now discuss relationships. If a task belongs to a user, and a user can have many tasks, how can we represent that with Laravel?

## Gravatars and Eager Loading

Ever heard of the N + 1 dilemma? Well, you'll see it first-hand in this lesson, along with how to fix it. Also, along the way, we'll add support for displaying Gravatars next to tasks.

## Cleanup

In this lesson, we'll tackle a number of different things. Mostly, though, the name of the game is cleanup.

## Forms

In this lesson, we'll build a form to create new tasks. In particular, we'll learn how to, when filling out the form, specify which user we wish to assign the task to.

## Validation Services

We can't allow users to create new tasks, without first filtering the form data through some form of validation! Get ready, because we'll tackle a number of topics in this lesson, including the single responsibility principle, service classes, custom exceptions, and more.

If this episode feels a bit overwhelming, that's okay. It's just a teaser. In the next lesson, we'll review a different approach: validation with model events.

## Validation Redux and Completing Tasks

In the previous lesson, I demonstrated a high-level way to manage your validation. We used services and custom exceptions to handle the flow. In this lesson, however, we'll back-track and try a different approach: hooking into model events.

As with many things in the coding world, there are multiple ways to achieve a particular end goal.

As we slowly begin to finish up this demo project, we need to take some time to allow users to complete tasks (and style those tasks accordingly).
